# Userinyerface Selenium speedrun

I fist came across [userinyerface.com](https://userinyerface.com/) during my
QA automation engineering internship. I liked the concept a lot, and decided
to "speedrun" it to present what I've learned. 


I originally implemented a page object model using  
[Aquality](https://github.com/aquality-automation/aquality-selenium-java).
I realise that abstraction and extra libraries will slow me down a bit, but
this is primarily a demo of my skills and practices - the speedruning
challenge is just a bonus. I might create a leaner version on another branch and
compare the results.
