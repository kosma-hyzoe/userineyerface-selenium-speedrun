# Userinyerface Selenium speedrun

I fist came across [userinyerface.com](https://userinyerface.com/) during my
QA automation engineering internship. I liked the concept a lot, and decided
to "speedrun" it to present what I've learned. 


I originally implemented a page object model using Page Object Model with
[Aquality](https://github.com/aquality-automation/aquality-selenium-java),
but I'll only use "vanilla" Selenium.
I realise that abstraction and extra libraries will slow me down a bit, but
this is primarily a demo of the best practices and skills I've - the
speedruning challenge is a bonus. I might create a leaner version on another
branch and compare the results.
